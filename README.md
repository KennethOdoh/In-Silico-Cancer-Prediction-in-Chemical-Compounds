# In-Silico Prediction of Carcinogenicity in Chemical Compounds
---
Toxicity is a major cause of drug candidate failure in preclinical and phase I trials. This process is lengthy, costly, and high-risk, with estimated average cost of $1-2 billion and a development timeline of about 10-15 years.

This project presents binary classification models designed to predict the carcinogenicity potential of chemical substances in drug discovery. The models utilize Morgan's fingerprints and are implemented in KNIME Analytics.

This work contributes to the growing body of research supporting in-silico computational methods as viable alternatives to traditional laboratory approaches, which heavily rely on physical specimens.
